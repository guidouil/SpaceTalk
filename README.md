SpaceTalk is an open-source chat app built with Meteor.

Note: SpaceTalk is beta software. Most of it should work but it's still a little unpolished and you'll probably find some bugs. Use at your own risk :)

### Disclaimer

This code was part of a [Meteor Workshop](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-Goteborg/events/221282857/) that took place on the 14th of May 2015 in Gothenburg, Sweden.

We used it to build a chat application in 25 steps (https://slides.com/timbrandin/meteor-slack) – it was originally designed to look a little bit like Slack.

But it was solely made do demonstrate the efficiency and simple nature of Meteor applications.
